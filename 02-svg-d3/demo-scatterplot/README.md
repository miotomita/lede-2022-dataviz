# D3 + SVG demo

This is a starter template for a simple project to build a scatterplot with D3 based on [this Gapminder chart](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles&url=v1).

## Getting setup

In order to run this locally on your computer you will need to have several things installed:

- NodeJS ([instructions](https://github.com/jsoma/interactives-class-content/blob/main/301-setup-node.md))
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or another editor + terminal)
- A web browser

You can either clone this repo with git or the github desktop app onto your computer, or you can download this folder [TK]().

If you don't have everything installed on your computer, you can use the website [CodePen](https://codepen.io) to code along. Sign up for an account if you don't have one and fork [this pen](https://codepen.io/mitchthorson/pen/XWErwxz).

Once you have this folder on your computer, open it in VSCode.

Open a `terminal` in VSCode and run the command:

```console
npm install 
```

If this doesn't work, it may be because your NodeJS installation is not working properly. Ask for some help, or try using the CodePen above.

If the `npm install` command did work for you, then go ahead and run

```console
npm start
```

You can then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
